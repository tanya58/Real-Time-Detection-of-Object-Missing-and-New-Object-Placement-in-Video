# Real-Time-Detection-of-Object-Missing-and-New-Object-Placement-in-Video

This project focuses on building a real-time video analytics system capable of detecting two key scenarios:
1.	Missing Object Detection – Identifying when a previously visible object disappears from the scene.
2.	New Object Placement Detection – Identifying when a new object appears in the scene.
The primary goal is to create a reliable, high-performance pipeline for detecting these events as they occur, with real-time alerts displayed on the video feed. The system uses deep learning techniques for object detection and continuously processes video frames to ensure the analytics are accurate and timely.
